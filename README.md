# üöÄ Essential MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Welcome to the Essential MCP workspace! This is where Hue and Aye collaborate to create amazing MCP implementations. We're building a suite of tools that make AI-human interaction more powerful, contextual, and fun!

## üåü Core Features

### üì¶ Packages

#### MCP Server Enhanced SSH
A powerful SSH server enabling secure remote command execution with:
- Persistent TMUX sessions
- Multi-window support
- Session sharing capabilities
- Smart session recovery

#### MCP Awesome Tool Collection (ATC)
A Python-powered API that serves as our central hub for all tools:
- Plugin-based architecture
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Tool discovery and management
- Context-aware execution

### üß† Unified Context System

Our crown jewel! A sophisticated context management system that:

#### Context Types
- `TEST`: Test execution and validation contexts
- `TOOL`: Tool execution and state contexts
- `PARTICIPANT`: User and AI behavioral contexts
- `FEELING`: Emotional and sentiment contexts
- `CONVERSATION`: Interaction and dialogue contexts
- `SYSTEM`: System state and performance contexts

#### Smart Model Management
- Automatic HuggingFace model discovery
- Context-specific model selection
- Performance-based model evaluation
- Dynamic model updating
- Multi-dimensional embedding support

#### Qdrant Integration
- Semantic search across all contexts
- Multi-vector storage for different context types
- Relationship tracking between contexts
- Fast similarity search

### üß™ Test or Forget (ToF) System

An innovative testing approach that:
- Maintains context awareness in tests
- Automatically validates context preservation
- Detects and recovers from context loss
- Uses semantic similarity for test relationships
- Provides real-time test insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI for API
- WebSockets for real-time communication
- Qdrant for vector storage
- HuggingFace for ML models
- sentence-transformers for embeddings

### Authentication
- Modern authentication methods (coming soon)
  - Voice pattern recognition
  - Location-based trust factors
  - Behavioral patterns
  - Text pattern analysis

### Development Tools
- Poetry for dependency management
- pytest for testing
- Black for formatting
- mypy for type checking

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/essential-mcp.git
cd essential-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Start Qdrant:
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

4. Run the SSH server:
```bash
poetry run python -m mcp_server_enhanced_ssh
```

## üéØ Remember

- Context is everything!
- Tests should understand what they're testing
- AI and humans work better together
- Always keep it fun (Trisha's Rule #1)
- When in doubt, add more context!
