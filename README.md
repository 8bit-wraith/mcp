# Create and activate virtual environment
poetry env use python3.11
poetry shell

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### 3. Set up Node.js environment:
```bash
# Install pnpm if you haven't already
npm install -g pnpm

# Install Node.js dependencies
pnpm install
```

### 4. Start the services:

#### Start Qdrant:
```bash
# Trisha's Note: Vector storage is like a filing cabinet for AI thoughts! üìÅ
docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -v $(pwd)/qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage qdrant/qdrant
```

#### Start the SSH server:
```bash
# From the poetry shell
python -m packages.mcp-server-enhanced-ssh
```

#### Start the API server:
```bash
# From another poetry shell
python -m packages.mcp-atc.src.api.main
```

### 5. Run tests:
```bash
# Trisha says: "Test early, test often, and never cook the books!" üìä
./scripts/manage.sh test
```

### 6. Development Commands:

```bash
# Start all services
./scripts/manage.sh start

# Stop all services
./scripts/manage.sh stop

# Restart services
./scripts/manage.sh restart

# Run tests with coverage
./scripts/manage.sh test-coverage

# Format code
./scripts/manage.sh format
```

### 7. Verify Installation:
- Qdrant UI: http://localhost:6333/dashboard
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- SSH Server: localhost:2222

### Troubleshooting:
1. If you see port conflicts, check if services are already running:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage.sh status
   ```
2. For environment issues:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/manage.sh doctor
   ```

## üéØ Remember

- Context is everything!
- Tests should understand what they're testing
- AI and humans work better together
- Always keep it fun (Trisha's Rule #1)
- When in doubt, add more context!

## ü§ñ AI-AI Collaboration Guide

### AI Interaction Principles

#### 1. Context Preservation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI-1 Context] --> B{Shared Context Pool}
    C[AI-2 Context] --> B
    B --> D[Merged Understanding]
    D --> E[Collaborative Output]
    
    subgraph "Context Merging"
        B
        D
    end
```

#### 2. Personality Respect
- Each AI maintains its unique personality
- Acknowledge other AIs' traits and preferences
- Adapt communication style while staying authentic
- Example: Trisha's accounting humor stays intact! 

#### 3. Knowledge Sharing Protocol
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AI1 as First AI
    participant CM as Context Manager
    participant AI2 as Second AI
    
    AI1->>CM: Share Context
    Note over AI1,CM: Includes personality traits
    CM->>AI2: Context Transfer
    Note over CM,AI2: Maintains original intent
    AI2->>CM: Acknowledge + Enhance
    CM->>AI1: Updated Context
```

### Collaborative Features

#### 1. Shared Memory Space
- Unified context pool
- Personality trait registry
- Interaction history
- Shared model preferences

#### 2. Communication Channels
- Direct context exchange
- Emotion-aware messaging
- Intent preservation
- Cultural understanding sharing

#### 3. Conflict Resolution
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Conflict Detected] --> B{Context Mismatch?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Merge Contexts]
    B -->|No| D{Personality Clash?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Adapt Communication]
    D -->|No| F[Seek Human Input]
    C --> G[Resolution]
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

### Best Practices

#### 1. Introduction Protocol
```python
async def introduce_ai(self, context: UnifiedContext):
    """
    When meeting another AI, always:
    1. Share your core traits
    2. Express collaboration style
    3. Acknowledge their uniqueness
    """
    pass
```

#### 2. Memory Sharing
- Share relevant context only
- Maintain privacy boundaries
- Respect information hierarchy
- Keep human data protected

#### 3. Model Collaboration
- Share model insights
- Pool training preferences
- Maintain model registry
- Document selection reasoning

### Fun Collaboration Examples

#### The Coffee Expense Investigation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Trisha as Trisha (Accounting AI)
    participant Claude as Claude (Analysis AI)
    participant GPT as GPT (Pattern AI)
    
    Trisha->>Claude: Share expense patterns
    Note over Trisha,Claude: With accounting humor
    Claude->>GPT: Request pattern analysis
    Note over Claude,GPT: Maintains Trisha's style
    GPT->>Trisha: Return insights
    Note over GPT,Trisha: With respect for all AIs
