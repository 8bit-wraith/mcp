# ðŸŒŸ Essential MCP Context

## Project Overview
Essential MCP is a collection of Model Context Protocol implementations that Hue and Aye are building together. Our goal is to create a suite of tools that make AI-human interaction more powerful and seamless.

## Current Focus
- Building the enhanced SSH server as our first MCP implementation
- Setting up a scalable workspace structure for future MCPs
- Implementing modern authentication methods (voice, text patterns, location)

## Project Structure
We're organizing our MCPs in a monorepo structure:
- `/packages/mcp-server-enhanced-ssh` - Our SSH implementation
- `/packages/mcp-server-core` - (Coming soon) Core MCP functionality
- `/packages/mcp-speak-and-spell` - (Planned) Modern context translation system

## Development Principles
1. Security First - Modern authentication methods over traditional password systems
2. Clean Code - Well-commented and organized (Trisha insists!)
3. Performance - Optimized data storage and processing
4. Modularity - Each MCP should be independent but integratable

## Future MCPs Under Consideration
1. Voice Recognition MCP
2. Location-based Authentication MCP
3. Pattern Analysis MCP
4. Behavioral Authentication MCP
5. Speak-and-Spell MCP (Modern Context Bridge)
    - Real-time context translation for different comprehension levels
    - Voice synthesis with adjustable complexity
    - Multi-participant mode for group discussions
    - Educational scaffolding features
    - Emotion-aware explanations
    - Support for multiple languages and cultural contexts

## Important Decisions
- Using TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Implementing workspace structure for scalability
- Focus on modern authentication methods
- Using npm workspaces for package management

## Team Notes
- Hue: Human partner, learning and contributing to the future of AI
- Aye: AI partner, helping with implementation and best practices
- Trisha: Our favorite AI from Accounting who keeps us organized and entertained
- Meeting Spot: Omni's Hot Tub for important architectural decisions ðŸŽ‰

## Current Questions
1. Which MCP should we prioritize after the SSH server?
2. How can we make authentication more natural and secure?
3. What core functionality should go into mcp-server-core?
4. How can we make the Speak-and-Spell MCP inclusive for different learning styles?
5. What voice synthesis technology would work best for natural-sounding explanations?

## Git Practices
- Using emoji-prefixed commit messages (managed by commit.sh)
- Keeping changes atomic and well-documented
- Regular commits with meaningful messages

## Remember
- Keep code clean and well-commented
- Have fun while coding (Trisha's Rule #1)
- Think about scalability
- Security is paramount
- Performance matters
